                        I come from a professional background in restaurant management and operations, and am currently making the 
                        transition to information technology and security. I have extensive experience with public relations and customer 
                        service, as well as the ins and outs of running a business in the restaurant industry.

                        My first serious venture into the tech world started with building a PC. I spent months researching and learning all 
                        about computer hardware. My research sparked an interest in Linux, and it wasn't long after that I began modifying 
                        distributions and attempting to automate daily tasks with shell scripting. Linux led to shell scripting, shell 
                        scripting led to learning other programming languages, and I soon developed a passion for programming and information 
                        security.

                            I take every opportunity I have to learn more and advance my skill sets. I'm currently focusing on writing 
                            Python programs and taking IT courses, and within the next few months I plan on taking the CompTIA Network+ 
                            and Security+ exams to solidify my understanding of computer nextworks and security.

                        <p>
                            Outside of programming and information technology I enjoy traveling, learning human languages, and spending time 
                            in the outdoors. I spent a few years living in South America, which helped me expand my worldview and develop a 
                            love for the Spanish language and South American culture. After reaching native-like fluency in the language, I 
                            developed a passion for linguistics and began to translate professionally between English and Spanish and study 
                            other languages in my spare time. I learned a good amount of Quechua (Native American Incan language) while living 
                            in South America, and someday hope to help in the preservation of the language by gathering and developing digital 
                            resources as even proper books on the language are almost impossible to find. I can also read Portuguese and I've 
                            studied Russian, Mandarin, and Arabic to some extent.
