                        ARP, or Address Resolution Protocol, connects an IP address to a MAC address in a LAN network. ARP could be seen 
                        as a translation process from a 32 bit address (IPv4) and a MAC address which is 48 bits long. The translation 
                        process is important to allow computers on a LAN network to be able to communicate with each other.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Here's an example to illustrate how this works and make this all a little easier to understand:
                    </p>
                    <br>                        
                    <p>
                        Let's say we have a small LAN network consisting of four computers and a router. Each device on the network 
                        has a unique IP address as well as a unique MAC address. If computer 1 wants to communicate with computer 3, 
                        it needs to know the MAC address of that machine because communication inside a local network relies on MAC 
                        addresses and not IP addresses. Assuming computer 1 already knows the IP address of computer 3, the computer 
                        can use ARP to discover computer 3's MAC address. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        First, computer 1 will check ARP to see if the IP to MAC address already exists. If it doesn't, computer 1 will 
                        send a request packet containing computer 3's IP address to all devices on the network. All of those devices 
                        will receive the packet, but only the computer that has that IP address will respond with its MAC address. 
                        Since computer 3 has the matching IP address in this example, it will be the device to respond.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Essentially, the host machine will ask all devices on the network if they have a certain IP address. All of the 
                        devices will ignore the request except for the device that has a matching IP address, and that device will reply 
                        with it's MAC address, allowing ARP to create an IP to MAC address translation.
