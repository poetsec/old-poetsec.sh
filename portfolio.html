                    <p>
                        Here are a few of the projects I've been working on. In addition to my own personal projects, I enjoy contributing 
                        to open source wherever I can. I also write about Linux and cybersecurity topics on my blog on this website and Hashnode.

                    <h3 style="color: #EF1493;text-align: center;">MAC Address Changer</h3>
                    <p>
                        This command-line MAC address spoofer allows the user to mask their MAC address from the command-line. It asks the 
                        user to specify an interface, choose a new MAC address, and then masks their real MAC addresss with the new, 
                        specified one. This was written as part of a course on ethical hacking and Python concepts by Zaid Sabih.

                    <h3 style="color: #EF1493;text-align: center;">Network Scanners</h3>
                    <p>
                        I created a set of network scanners in Python using the Scapy module. One is a simple scanner that uses 
                        <code>scapy.arping</code> to perform the network scan, and the other is a more customized scanner that has a 
                        manual scan function written out step by step, uses dictionaries to organize the information it collects, and 
                        displays that information to the user in an easy to read table. These were both created as part of a course on 
                        ethical hacking and Python concepts by Zaid Sabih. <a href="https://github.com/poetsec/network-scanners">See code.</a>

                    <h3 style="color: #EF1493;text-align: center;">File Encypter/Decrypter</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a bash shell script for encrypting and decrypting files. When run, it gives the user the option to either 
                        encrypt or decrypt a file that they select using GPG.

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;color: #EF1493;">Random Password Generator</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a bash shell script for generating random passwords. It prompts the user for the number of characters they 
                        would like their new password to be, and then generates five random passwords.

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;color: #EF1493;">Cash Drawer Calculator</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a work-in-progress program to help cashiers balance tills. It allows the user to enter the number of each 
                        cash denomination they have, and then does the math to come up with the total dollar amount. It's based on a 
                        Microsoft Excel sheet I've used in the restaurant industry, and I plan on making improvements in the future such 
                        as adding options for foreign currencies and a GUI.

                    <h3 style="color: #EF1493;text-align: center;">Personal Websites</h3>
                    <p> I've built my own website (this website) from scratch, learning a lot about HTML and CSS along the way. I've been 
                        able to format it and style it the way I want: minimalist and something that just works. I've also created another 
                        portfolio website for GitHub Pages, with which I started with a simple free template and began customizing it from 
                        there. I've changed the layout, added pages and features, edited styling, and of course created the content. This 
                        project has helped me to learn a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I edit and re-work the website to fit my 
                        wants and needs.
